### Full Documentation

- **Installation Guide**: See [Installation](#installation) section below
- **Usage Examples**: See [Usage](#usage) section below
- **Contributing**: See [Contributing](#contributing) section below
- **Project Goals**: See [Why TaskWeaver?](#why-taskweaver) section below

## Why TaskWeaver?

TaskWeaver addresses a common challenge: **complex goals often fail because they're too overwhelming to start or unclear how to proceed.**

### The Problem

- Large projects feel insurmountable without proper breakdown
- You don't know what skills you're missing until you start
- Learning feels disconnected from doing (violates JIT learning principles)
- Task prioritization is subjective and inconsistent
- Dependencies between tasks aren't always clear

### The Solution

TaskWeaver provides:

- **Intelligent Task Decomposition**: Automatically breaks complex goals into manageable chunks
- **Skill Gap Analysis**: Identifies what you need to learn before starting tasks
- **Just-In-Time Learning**: Creates learning tasks that directly unblock your goals
- **Smart Prioritization**: Uses multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) for objective task scoring
- **Dependency Management**: Tracks task relationships and detects circular dependencies
- **Adaptive Learning**: Remembers your preferences and adjusts recommendations over time

### Core Principles

1. **JIT Learning**: Learning without action isn't learning - all learning tasks directly support doing
2. **Skill-Based Planning**: Tasks are matched to your current Dreyfus skill level
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Focus on what's immediately actionable, not everything at once
4. **Dogfooding**: Built to improve itself - the first user is the project itself

## Current Status

**Version:** 0.5.0 (Released: 2025-01-23)
**Development Stage:** Core Complete, Building Usability Features

**Recently Completed:**

- âœ… Web search integration via DuckDuckGo (v0.5.0)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13 or higher**
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager** (a fast Python package and project manager written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/))

#### Installing Prerequisites

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
# Install Python (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3.13 python3-pip

# Install UV
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**macOS:**

```bash
# Install Python via Homebrew (if needed)
brew install python@3.13

# Install UV
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
# Install Python from python.org first, then:
# Install UV
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
# Install Python (usually pre-installed)
sudo pacman -S python

# Install UV
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install the package

```bash
# Clone from source (currently the only installation method)
git clone https://github.com/TheRockPusher/taskweaver.git
cd taskweaver

# Install dependencies
make install

# Or manually with UV
uv sync
```

## Usage

### Interactive Chat Mode (Phase 2 - NEW)

Start an interactive conversation with the AI task orchestrator:

```bash
# Start chat session
uv run taskweaver chat

# Example conversation:
You: "I want to build a web app with authentication"

TaskWeaver: Let me break this down strategically...

You: "I'm new to web development"

TaskWeaver: [Creates a structured breakdown with foundational tasks first]
- Learn HTTP basics and REST principles
- Set up development environment (Python/Flask)
- Design database schema for users
- Implement basic authentication
- Create login UI
- Add security hardening

Ready to get started? Which task interests you most?
```

**Web Search Integration:**

The agent can search the web for current information when decomposing tasks. This enables:

- Looking up current best practices and library versions
- Finding recent tutorials and documentation
- Verifying technology choices and recommendations
- Grounding task creation in up-to-date information

The web search tool is powered by DuckDuckGo and activates automatically when the agent needs current information.

### CLI Task Management (Available Now)

```bash
# Create a task (title is required, rest optional)
uv run taskweaver create "Build authentication system" \
  --duration 120 \
  --value 8.5 \
  --req "JWT tokens working with test coverage" \
  --desc "Implement OAuth2 or JWT"

# List all tasks
uv run taskweaver ls

# List open tasks with dependency counts
uv run taskweaver lso

# Show task details
uv run taskweaver show <task-id>

# Mark tasks as in progress
uv run taskweaver edit <task-id> -s in_progress

# Complete a task
uv run taskweaver edit <task-id> -s completed

# Delete a task
uv run taskweaver rm <task-id>
```

### Dependency Management (Phase 2 - Complete)

Create and manage task relationships with automatic cycle detection:

```bash
# Create a dependency (task is blocked by blocker)
uv run taskweaver createDep <task-id> <blocker-id>

# Remove a dependency
uv run taskweaver rmdep <task-id> <blocker-id>

# View tasks blocking a specific task
uv run taskweaver blocker <task-id>
```

**Key Features:**

- Automatic circular dependency detection using breadth-first search
- Active blocker filtering (only pending/in_progress tasks block)
- Prevented dependencies on completed/cancelled tasks
- Dependency counts aggregated in tasks_full view

### Configuration

Set your LLM provider:

```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable
export API_KEY="sk-..."

# Option 2: .env file
echo "API_KEY=sk-..." > .env

# Option 3: config.toml
cat > config.toml << EOF
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
api_endpoint = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
EOF
```

Supports any LLM provider compatible with the endpoint format (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models).

### Success Metrics (MVP Targets)

The MVP implementation will aim to achieve these goals:

- Add complex tasks via conversation (no CLI flags required)
- Automatic task decomposition, gap detection, and prioritization
- User approval and adjustment workflow before committing to database
- Learning tasks correctly unblock parent tasks
- Score inference accuracy >70% (user accepts without edits)
- Decomposition acceptance rate >70%
- System learns preferences after 20+ task completions

### Development Approach

The project is being developed using a "dogfooding" approach - TaskWeaver will be used to organize its own development. This means the project roadmap, development tasks, and progress will be managed through the system as it's being built, providing real-world validation of the approach.

More detailed usage examples and workflows will be added as features are implemented.

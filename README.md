# [TaskWeaver](https://github.com/TheRockPusher/taskweaver)

An AI-powered task organizer and decomposer that helps you break down complex goals into manageable, actionable tasks.

TaskWeaver is a conversational AI agent that intelligently organizes, prioritizes, and decomposes your tasks. It analyzes your skill level, identifies knowledge gaps, and creates learning paths to help you accomplish your goals efficiently.

**Target Audience:** Anyone looking to organize complex projects, learn new skills systematically, or improve task management through AI-powered decomposition and prioritization.

**Project Status:** Version 0.1.0 (early development - MVP stage)

## Getting Started

TaskWeaver helps you accomplish complex goals by breaking them down into achievable tasks, detecting skill gaps, and creating personalized learning paths.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheRockPusher/taskweaver.git
cd taskweaver

# Install UV if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
make install

# Run tests to verify installation
make test
```

Note: TaskWeaver is currently in active development. The CLI is not yet functional. Development focus is on core infrastructure and feature implementation. Check back soon for updates!

### Full Documentation

- **Installation Guide**: See [Installation](#installation) section below
- **Usage Examples**: See [Usage](#usage) section below
- **Contributing**: See [Contributing](#contributing) section below
- **Project Goals**: See [Why TaskWeaver?](#why-taskweaver) section below

## Why TaskWeaver?

TaskWeaver addresses a common challenge: **complex goals often fail because they're too overwhelming to start or unclear how to proceed.**

### The Problem

- Large projects feel insurmountable without proper breakdown
- You don't know what skills you're missing until you start
- Learning feels disconnected from doing (violates JIT learning principles)
- Task prioritization is subjective and inconsistent
- Dependencies between tasks aren't always clear

### The Solution

TaskWeaver provides:

- **Intelligent Task Decomposition**: Automatically breaks complex goals into manageable chunks
- **Skill Gap Analysis**: Identifies what you need to learn before starting tasks
- **Just-In-Time Learning**: Creates learning tasks that directly unblock your goals
- **Smart Prioritization**: Uses multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) for objective task scoring
- **Dependency Management**: Tracks task relationships and detects circular dependencies
- **Adaptive Learning**: Remembers your preferences and adjusts recommendations over time

### Core Principles

1. **JIT Learning**: Learning without action isn't learning - all learning tasks directly support doing
2. **Skill-Based Planning**: Tasks are matched to your current Dreyfus skill level
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Focus on what's immediately actionable, not everything at once
4. **Dogfooding**: Built to improve itself - the first user is the project itself

## Current Status

**Project Stage:** Early Development - Scaffolding Only

The project is currently in the initial scaffolding phase. Core infrastructure and project structure have been set up, but no features have been implemented yet. The roadmap below outlines the planned features for the MVP.

- Comprehensive code quality tools (Ruff, Ty, pytest with 80% coverage)
- Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD automation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13 or higher**
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager** (a fast Python package and project manager written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/))

#### Installing Prerequisites

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
# Install Python (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3.13 python3-pip

# Install UV
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**macOS:**

```bash
# Install Python via Homebrew (if needed)
brew install python@3.13

# Install UV
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
# Install Python from python.org first, then:
# Install UV
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
# Install Python (usually pre-installed)
sudo pacman -S python

# Install UV
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install the package

```bash
# Clone from source (currently the only installation method)
git clone https://github.com/TheRockPusher/taskweaver.git
cd taskweaver

# Install dependencies
make install

# Or manually with UV
uv sync
```

## Usage

TaskWeaver is currently in early development and is not yet ready for end-user usage. The following example illustrates the intended usage pattern once implementation is complete:

### Planned Usage Example

```bash
# Start a conversation with TaskWeaver
uv run taskweaver

# Example conversation (planned functionality):
You: "I want to build a web application with authentication"

TaskWeaver: I'll help you break this down. Let me analyze this task...

[TaskWeaver will analyze your goal and create:]
- Main task: Build web application with authentication
  - Subtask: Design database schema for users
  - Subtask: Implement authentication backend
  - Subtask: Create login/signup UI
  - Learning task: Learn JWT basics (blocks authentication backend)
  - Learning task: Study password hashing best practices (blocks authentication backend)

Based on your current skill level (beginner in web auth), I recommend starting with
the learning tasks. Would you like me to add these to your task list?
```

**Status:** This functionality is currently being designed and implemented. Check the project roadmap for updates on feature availability.

### Success Metrics (MVP Targets)

The MVP implementation will aim to achieve these goals:

- Add complex tasks via conversation (no CLI flags required)
- Automatic task decomposition, gap detection, and prioritization
- User approval and adjustment workflow before committing to database
- Learning tasks correctly unblock parent tasks
- Score inference accuracy >70% (user accepts without edits)
- Decomposition acceptance rate >70%
- System learns preferences after 20+ task completions

### Development Approach

The project is being developed using a "dogfooding" approach - TaskWeaver will be used to organize its own development. This means the project roadmap, development tasks, and progress will be managed through the system as it's being built, providing real-world validation of the approach.

More detailed usage examples and workflows will be added as features are implemented.
